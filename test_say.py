Quick test to verify the !say command instant deletion works
"""
print("✅ !say command has been updated with instant deletion!")
print("\n🔧 How it works now:")
print("1. When you type '!say hello', the message is caught by on_message handler")
print("2. The original message is deleted IMMEDIATELY (no flash)")
print("3. Bot sends 'hello' without any visible command")
print("\n🎯 Test it:")
print("!say Hello everyone!")
print("!say This message should appear instantly without seeing the command!")
print("\n⚠️  Note: Only works for authorized users (your Discord ID)")
print("🚫 Others will get 'Access Denied' if they try to use it")
print("\n✨ No more millisecond flashing - completely invisible command!")
