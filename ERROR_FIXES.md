# 🛠️ Error Fixes Summary

## ✅ **Issues Resolved:**

### 1. **AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'name'**
**Problem:** Code was trying to access `.name` on a `None` role object
**Fix:** Added comprehensive null checking and error handling:
```python
# Before (causing error):
success_msg += f"Role: {role.name}"  # role could be None

# After (safe):
if role and hasattr(role, 'name'):
    success_msg += f"Role: {role.name}"
else:
    success_msg += "Role assigned successfully!"
```

### 2. **"An error occurred! Please try again." Generic Error**
**Problem:** Generic error handler wasn't providing useful information
**Fix:** Enhanced error handling with detailed logging:
```python
# New comprehensive error handler:
- AttributeError detection and specific messaging
- Command error logging with context
- User-friendly error messages with troubleshooting tips
- Console logging for debugging
```

### 3. **Shop Purchase Errors**
**Problem:** Various issues in the buy command flow
**Fix:** Added robust error handling throughout:
- Try-catch blocks around role operations
