# 🛒 **SHOP SYSTEM ADDED!** 

## ✅ **New Features Implemented:**

### **🛒 Private Shop System**
- **`!shop`** - Browse the coin shop (only visible to you!)
- **`!buy <number>`** - Purchase items from the shop
- Shop interface automatically deletes after 30 seconds for privacy
- Only the user who runs the command can see the shop

### **🏪 Shop Items Available:**

#### **🗣️ Say Command Unlock - 1,000,000 coins**
- Unlocks the `!say` command for regular users
- Once purchased, you can use `!say` and `!stealth_say` commands
- Previously owner-only, now available for purchase!

#### **👑 Role Purchases:**
1. **⭐ VIP Role - 50,000 coins**
2. **💎 Premium Role - 100,000 coins**
3. **🏆 Legendary Role - 250,000 coins**
4. **👑 Elite Role - 500,000 coins**

### **💾 Persistent Data Storage**
- **Coins never reset!** Data is saved to `user_data.json`
- Bot restart won't affect your coins or purchases
- All purchases and unlocks are permanently saved
- Data automatically saves when you earn/spend coins

### **🔐 Updated Authorization System**
- `!say` command now checks for shop unlock OR owner status
- `!stealth_say` also uses the new system
- Shop purchases are permanent and persist across restarts

## 🎯 **How It Works:**

### **Shopping Experience:**
1. **Type `!shop`** - See all available items (private message)
2. **Check prices** - See what you can afford with green ✅ or red ❌
3. **Use `!buy <number>`** - Purchase by item number (1-5)
4. **Get confirmation** - Success message with remaining balance

### **Privacy Features:**
- Shop messages auto-delete after 30 seconds
- Purchase confirmations show for 15 seconds then disappear
- No one else can see your shop browsing or purchases

### **Say Command Unlock:**
- **Before:** Only bot owner could use `!say`
- **After:** Anyone with 1,000,000 coins can unlock it
- **Permanent:** Once unlocked, always unlocked (saved to file)

### **Role System:**
- Roles are automatically created if they don't exist
- You get the role immediately after purchase
- Roles have different colors and show hierarchy
- If bot can't create roles, you still get the purchase (just no role assigned)
