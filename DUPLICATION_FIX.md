# 🎯 DUPLICATION ISSUE - FIXED!

## ✅ **Problem Solved: Command Duplication**

### **🐛 What Was Causing the Duplication:**
The `on_message` event was calling `bot.process_commands(message)` **twice**:
1. Once for regular commands that start with `!` (except `!say`)
2. Once again at the end of the function for all messages

This caused every command to be processed and executed twice, leading to duplicate responses.

### **🔧 The Fix:**
- **Removed** the duplicate `process_commands` call at the end
- **Consolidated** command processing into a single location
- **Added** proper conditions to prevent double processing

### **📋 Changes Made:**
```python
# OLD (CAUSING DUPLICATES):
if message.content.startswith('!') and not message.content.startswith('!say'):
    await bot.process_commands(message)  # First call
    return

# ... other code ...

await bot.process_commands(message)  # Second call - DUPLICATE!

# NEW (FIXED):
# Process all commands except !say (which is handled above)
if message.content.startswith('!') and not message.content.startswith('!say'):
    await bot.process_commands(message)  # Only one call!
```
