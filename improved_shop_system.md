# Improved Shop System - Server-Based Private Messages

## 🎯 **Enhancement Complete: Server-Based Private Shop**

### **What Changed:**
Instead of sending shop messages to DMs, the shop now appears **in the server channel** but with privacy features:

### **How It Works Now:**

#### **1. Shop Command (`!shop`)**
- **Location:** Appears in server channel (not DMs)
- **Privacy:** Message mentions you, then edits to remove mention
- **Auto-Delete:** Message deletes after 45 seconds
- **Guild Context:** Maintains server context for role operations

#### **2. Visual Flow:**
```
User types: !shop

Step 1: 🔒 @YourName [Shop Embed]
        ↓ (1 second delay)
Step 2: 🔒 Private Shop (auto-deleting) [Shop Embed]
        ↓ (45 seconds later)  
Step 3: Message deletes automatically
```

#### **3. Benefits:**
✅ **Guild Context Preserved** - Role assignments work perfectly  
✅ **Still Private** - Quick appearance then auto-deletion  
✅ **No DM Issues** - Works even if DMs are disabled  
✅ **Clean Server** - Messages auto-delete to keep channels tidy  
✅ **Role Equipping Works** - Button interactions have proper guild context  

### **User Experience:**

#### **Shopping Process:**
1. **Type `!shop` in server** - Command message gets deleted immediately
2. **Shop appears for you** - Shows your balance and all items  
3. **Message auto-deletes** - Clean server after 45 seconds
4. **Use `!buy 2`** - Purchase items by number
5. **Role equipping works** - Buttons function properly in server context

#### **Privacy Features:**
- **Quick mention removal** - Your name disappears after 1 second
- **Auto-deletion** - Messages don't clutter the server
- **Private appearance** - Clear indicators it's for you only
- **Server-only** - Prevents DM usage where roles don't work

### **Technical Improvements:**
- **Guild context maintained** - No more `None` guild errors
- **Button interactions work** - Proper server context for role assignment
- **Error handling** - Server-only enforcement prevents DM issues
- **Clean appearance** - Professional-looking private messages

### **What You'll See:**
