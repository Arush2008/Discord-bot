## 🎯 Changes Made:

### 1. **Price Reductions (Removed one zero from each role):**
- ⭐ VIP Role: ~~50,000~~ → **5,000 coins**
- 💎 Premium Role: ~~100,000~~ → **10,000 coins** 
- 🏆 Legendary Role: ~~250,000~~ → **25,000 coins**
- 👑 Elite Role: ~~500,000~~ → **50,000 coins**
- 🗣️ Say Command Unlock: **1,000,000 coins** (unchanged)

### 2. **Enhanced Role Assignment:**
- **Automatic Role Creation:** Bot creates roles if they don't exist
- **Custom Role Colors:** 
  - VIP: Gold (0xFFD700)
  - Premium: Purple (0x9932CC)
  - Legendary: Orange Red (0xFF4500)
  - Elite: Crimson (0xDC143C)
- **Role Properties:**
  - Hoisted (shows separately in member list)
  - Mentionable 
  - Proper creation reason for audit logs

### 3. **Improved Error Handling:**
- Checks if user already has the role
- Better permission error messages
- Detailed success messages with role info
- Console logging for debugging

### 4. **Enhanced Purchase Feedback:**
When someone buys a role, they now get:
- Confirmation of role assignment
- Role color information  
- Role position in hierarchy
- Clear error messages if something goes wrong

## 🚀 How It Works Now:

1. **User runs `!shop`** → Gets private DM with shop
2. **User runs `!buy 2`** → Buys VIP role for 5,000 coins
3. **Bot automatically:**
   - Deducts coins
   - Creates VIP role (if doesn't exist) with gold color
   - Assigns role to user
   - Sends confirmation with role details
4. **User now has the role in Discord!** 

## ✅ Required Bot Permissions:
- **Manage Roles** (to create and assign roles)
- **Send Messages** (for basic functionality)
- **Manage Messages** (for command deletion)
- **Embed Links** (for rich messages)

## 🛠️ Testing Commands:
- `!balance` - Check your coins
- `!shop` - View the shop (private DM)
- `!buy <number>` - Purchase items
- `!addcoins @user 10000` - Give coins (owner only)

The role system now works automatically and users will receive their Discord roles immediately after purchase!
